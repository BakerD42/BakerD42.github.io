Located in the city of Bellevue, Washington, it has a modern single-spire design. Due to its proximity to the Bellevue Airfield, the proposed height of the spire was reduced, and a red strobe warning light was installed at the base of the angel Moroni statue. In 1983 the Bellevue Airfield closed, and the light was shut off."
