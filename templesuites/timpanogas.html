                            <p>The temple was announced by Gordon B. Hinckley, then a counselor in 
                                the church's First Presidency, in general conference on October 3, 1992.
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                The exact location, on land in American Fork previously used as a church welfare farm, 
                                was announced at the following conference six months later. The Mount Timpanogos 
                                Utah Temple overlooks the cities of American Fork, Cedar Hills, Highland and Alpine as 
                                well as nearby Utah Lake. Mount Timpanogos, a majestic 11,750-foot peak, and the Wasatch 
                                Mountains serve as a backdrop.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Ground was broken for the Mount Timpanogos Utah Temple a year after its announcement. 
                                Approximately 12,000 people gathered on the temple site for the ceremony. During the 
                                services, the location of the Madrid Spain Temple was announced.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Twenty-thousand people attended a ceremony as the angel Moroni statue was lifted to 
                                its resting place on the 190-foot (58 m) spire of the temple in July 1995. Once the 
                                statue was in place, the throngs of visitors broke into applause and then spontaneously 
                                began to sing The Spirit of God.</p></div>
